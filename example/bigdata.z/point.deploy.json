Open for everyone, censorship-resistant, permissionless, privacy-oriented internet with programmable money known as cryptocurrency as its built-in payment system.\n\nPoint Network is a proposed implementation of this vision. In addition to the set of protocols serving as its foundation, it aims to provide a harmonious ecosystem for decentralized applications (dApps) and a consistent and straight-forward User Interface experience to expedite global adoption.",
