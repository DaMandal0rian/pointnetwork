Point Network is an implementation of decentralized internet, also known as web 3.0. Learn how it is designed to take control of your data away from nation states and corporations and give it back to you.

This repository contains the source code of the core of Point Network. It contains the core node implementation as well as docker configuration for running demos of the network on your local computer to test this out.
